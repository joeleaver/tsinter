# tsinter semantics register

Every place tsinter's observable behavior deliberately diverges from Node
gets a numbered entry here — **before** the change merges, not after. Code
comments cite entries as `SEMANTICS.md S###`; citing an entry that does not
exist is a bug (CI lint planned). Node remains the oracle for everything not
listed here: if a question isn't answered on this page, the answer is
"whatever `node` does, byte-for-byte", and the differential corpus enforces
it.

This register exists because our upstream (scriptc) maintained one and never
shipped it — its code cites a `SEMANTICS.md` with 350+ entries that is not in
the repo. We inherit the discipline, not the file. Entries marked
*(inherited)* reproduce upstream stances we verified empirically from the IR
contract, validator, and corpus rather than from their register.

Format: `S###` numbers are permanent and never reused. An entry states the
divergence, the rationale, and how it is tested.

---

## S001 — Numbers are f64, exactly and only *(inherited)*

Every `number` is an IEEE-754 double at every point in the pipeline,
including loop counters and array indices. There is no integer inference and
no machine-int fast path; bitwise operators apply ToInt32/ToUint32 and return
to f64, as in JS. Number→string formatting must be byte-exact to Node.
**Rationale:** JS-exact semantics beat lookalike-language performance; integer
unboxing is a future *optimization* that must never change observable
behavior. **Tested by:** entire differential corpus; upstream's Ryū-based
formatting was fuzz-verified against Node on 10⁶ doubles — the wasm runtime
must meet the same bar.

## S002 — Strings are UTF-16 code-unit indexed, JS-exact *(inherited)*

The IR string contract is UTF-16 code-unit semantics (`length`, indexing,
`slice`, comparison), matching JS exactly. Upstream's C runtime stored UTF-8
and paid translation costs plus a documented lone-surrogate divergence;
tsinter's WasmGC backend uses UTF-16-faithful representations, so this
divergence class is *removed*, not inherited. **Tested by:** corpus string
programs; the wasm emitter unit test pins lone-surrogate identity through
`charCodeAt`/`split("")`/`isWellFormed`/`toWellFormed` (a corpus program
cannot cover this — the native lanes still carry upstream's U+FFFD
substitution, so the removal is observable on the wasm tier only).

## S003 — Out-of-bounds array reads throw `RangeError` *(inherited)*

Arrays are dense; `a[i]` with `i` outside `[0, length)` throws `RangeError`
instead of returning `undefined`. This is the static tier's largest deliberate
semantic divergence from JS and the price of unboxed typed arrays.
**Rationale:** returning `undefined` would force every element type to be
`T | undefined`. **Tested by:** diagnostics fixtures + corpus programs using
`@exit:` lanes (cannot be differential-tested against Node by definition).

## S004 — Node platform APIs are refused, not emulated

The static tier compiles the language and core stdlib (`Math`, `String`,
`Array`, `Map`/`Set`, `JSON`, `console.log`, `Promise`). Node platform
surfaces (`fs`, `net`, `http`, `child_process`, `process.*` beyond a minimal
subset, …) are **refused at compile time with a named diagnostic** — never
stubbed, never silently absent at runtime. Host capabilities enter a tsinter
module only through its declared imports. **Rationale:** the output is a
sandboxed wasm module; ambient OS authority would be a lie at best and a
sandbox hole at worst. **Tested by:** wasm-differential harness refusal
histogram (Node-platform corpus programs must appear as refusals, not
failures).

## S005 — Source string relational comparison is code-point order *(inherited)*

`<` `<=` `>` `>=` between strings compare by Unicode CODE POINT, not by
UTF-16 code unit as ECMAScript specifies. The two orders disagree exactly
when a supplementary character (U+10000+) meets a BMP character in
[U+E000, U+FFFF]: JS sorts the supplementary FIRST (its high surrogate
0xD800-0xDBFF is a smaller unit), code-point order sorts it LAST. This is
the IR's documented contract for `strCmp` without the `utf16` flag; the flag
— set only by the default `Array.prototype.sort` comparator — requests the
ECMAScript unit order, so sorted output stays Node-exact. **Rationale:**
inherited stance; code-point order is arguably saner and the divergent
range is exotic. **Tested by:** the wasm emitter unit test pins one
divergent-range comparison against this entry; corpus programs stay outside
the divergent range (they must, to pass the Node differential).

## S006 — `pop()` on an empty array throws `RangeError` *(inherited)*

`Array.prototype.pop` is typed as the ELEMENT (not `elem | undefined`), and
popping an empty array throws `RangeError` instead of returning `undefined`
— S003's stance extended to the one removal method whose JS result type
would otherwise poison every element type with `| undefined`. `shift()` is
NOT part of this divergence: it stays JS-exact (`elem | undefined`,
`undefined` on empty) because its result already crosses the union
representation. The C runtime's `scr_arr_pop_slot` and the wasm backend's
pop emission share the stance; the "throw" is an UNCATCHABLE abort on both
tiers (`scr_trap` natively, a wasm trap reported as exit 1 through the S003
bridge) — native parity, not a temporary bridge: the may-throw analysis
counts runtime traps as aborts, so no pending check ever observes one. **Rationale:** inherited from the upstream runtime; the
asymmetry with shift is upstream's, kept because re-typing pop would touch
every corpus program using it. **Tested by:** corpus array programs (pop on
non-empty paths must match Node byte-for-byte); the wasm emitter unit test
covers non-empty pop and empty shift.

## S007 — Wasm tier: an UNCAUGHT exception reports as a trap; stderr is not Node's

*(Narrowed 2026-08-03: the original entry described uncaught-throw-as-trap
for a tier with no `tryCatch` at all. The exception protocol has since
landed — real throw/catch/finally/rethrow via a pending-flag unwind, the
native backends' model — so thrown values are always evaluated and
catchable. What survives is the UNCAUGHT half.)*

An exception that unwinds out of `%main` is uncaught: `_start` tests the
pending cell and traps, which the harness bridge reports as exit code 1 —
Node's uncaught-exception exit — while stderr carries only what the program
itself wrote to fd 2, with no Node-style uncaught-exception report (stack
traces are not captured; the native tier's uncaught printer writes "name:
message" where Node writes a trace, so stderr already diverges there too).
The same holds for an exception out of a MACROTASK callback: `_tick` tests
the cell after every timer and every immediate callback and traps there,
and a repeating interval whose callback threw does not re-arm — the process
is already dead, exactly as it is in Node. **Rationale:** the artifact ABI
has no exit-code channel; the trap IS the nonzero exit. **Tested by:**
corpus uncaught-throw programs and `1442-interval-throw` (stdout before the
throw plus exit code must match Node; the harness skips the stderr compare
for nonzero-exit programs); the wasm emitter unit test pins the
evaluation-order-then-trap case and the wasm timers unit test the
interval-callback one.

## S008 — Wasm tier: string `repeat`/`pad` size cap is 2^31 units

`String.prototype.repeat` with a negative or infinite count traps (the
spec's RangeError through the S003 bridge, exit 1 like Node). The SIZE
limit differs: results at or past 2^31 UTF-16 units trap, where Node's
RangeError fires around 2^29 units — so a result length in [2^29, 2^31)
that Node rejects may instead be attempted here and survive if the GC can
allocate it. **Rationale:** native parity — the C runtime's `scr_str_repeat` aborts
through `scr_trap` on the same conditions (an UNCATCHABLE termination where
Node throws a catchable RangeError; the may-throw analysis counts runtime
traps as aborts on every tier), and 2^31 is the wasm storage's own bound;
real programs between the thresholds are allocating gigabytes of string
either way. **Tested by:** the wasm emitter unit test covers the trap side
(negative count); the divergent window is deliberately untested — corpus
programs cannot sit in it without multi-GB appetites.

## S009 — A checked cast on a catch binding validates instead of erasing *(inherited)*

`e as C` on a catch binding is a RUNTIME check: a payload that is an
instance of `C` passes through, and anything else throws a catchable
`TypeError` reading `caught value is not an instance of <C> (checked cast)`.
Node erases the annotation, so `(e as Error).message` on a thrown string
evaluates to `undefined` there and throws here. **Rationale:** inherited —
`as` is the documented trust-but-verify spelling at every dynamic boundary
in this compiler (the `dyn` surface's casts behave the same way, and
`scr_caught_check_obj` is the C runtime's implementation), and a static tier
that erased it would have to represent every catch payload as `dyn` to keep
the `undefined` answer. **Tested by:** the wasm emitter unit test (a corpus
program cannot cover it — every backend diverges from Node the same way, so
there is no byte-exact lane to compare).

## S010 — Wasm tier: an unhandled promise rejection reports as a trap; stderr is not Node's

A promise that is REJECTED and never observed — nothing awaited it, and no
handler ran — is reported at the END of a microtask checkpoint: after
`_start`'s drain, and inside `_tick` after the drain that follows every
timer and immediate callback, which is where Node decides it too. The tier
writes `Unhandled promise rejection: <reason>` to fd 2 (the reason rendered
exactly as the native runtime's `scr_report_unhandled_rejections` renders
it: numbers through ToString, booleans as `true`/`false`, strings raw,
`Error`s as `name: message`) and then TRAPS, which the harness bridge
reports as exit code 1 — Node's unhandled-rejection exit. Node's own stderr
instead carries an `ERR_UNHANDLED_REJECTION` report with a stack trace.
Only the FIRST unobserved rejection is reported, like Node and like the
native lane. **Rationale:** S007's reasoning exactly — the artifact ABI has
no exit-code channel, so the trap IS the nonzero exit, and stack traces are
not captured on this tier. **Tested by:** the wasm async unit test (stdout
before quiescence plus the stderr line and the trap); the differential
corpus for the exit code (the harness skips the stderr compare for
nonzero-exit programs).

A REJECTED TOP-LEVEL-AWAIT ROOT reports through the same channel. The
module evaluation promise of a program using top-level await is
loader-owned — marked observed the moment it exists, so the ledger walk
above never answers for it — and its rejection is instead decided by the
checkpoint that observed it: the same `Unhandled promise rejection:
<reason>` line to fd 2, then the same trap, which stops the event loop
before any timer already armed can fire (Node terminates there too, so a
later timer is dead code on both sides — corpus 2653). Node's own stderr
carries the error and a stack trace, and for an unrelated rejection raised
in the SAME checkpoint Node reports the module error while this tier's
ledger walk runs first and reports the other one; both are exit 1 with the
same stdout, and the line they disagree over is stderr on a nonzero exit.
**Tested by:** corpus 2648/2651/2653 (stdout and exit code) and the wasm
top-level-await unit test (the stderr line, the trap, and the timer that
never runs).

## S011 — `Timeout.refresh()` cannot revive a one-shot that already fired *(inherited)*

`refresh()` re-arms a timer to now + its ORIGINAL delay. It works on an
ARMED timeout or interval and on the timer whose callback is currently
running (the common `t.refresh()`-inside-its-own-callback shape); but a
one-shot that fired on an EARLIER turn is gone from the heap, and
refreshing its handle is a silently tolerated no-op. Node revives it — a
fired `Timeout` object is still live and `refresh()` puts it back on the
clock. **Rationale:** inherited from the native tier (`scr_timer_refresh`),
where a fired one-shot has released its callback closure and there is
nothing left to re-arm; the compiled handle is an id into the heap, not an
object that outlives its entry, and giving every fired timeout an
indefinite afterlife would mean retaining every callback a program ever
armed. **Tested by:** the corpus pins the SUPPORTED shapes
(`1803-timeout-refresh`, refresh from inside the callback); the divergent
one is deliberately untested — a corpus program covering it could not
match Node on any backend.

## S012 — Wasm tier: an unsettled top-level await exits 13 without Node's warning

A program whose module evaluation promise is still PENDING when the event
loop runs dry exits 13 — Node's dedicated unsettled-top-level-await status
— which this tier answers through the `_status` export (abi.ts) rather
than a trap: the artifact has no exit-code channel, and 13 is not the
trap's 1. The DIVERGENCE is stderr: Node additionally writes a `Warning:
Detected unsettled top-level await at <file>:<line>` report naming the
await that never resumed, and this tier writes nothing at all. The loop is
not cut short by the pending root either way — timers already armed still
run to quiescence, and the verdict is taken after them. **Rationale:**
source locations are not carried into the artifact (the same reason S007
and S010 have no stack traces), so the warning could only be approximated;
the exit code, which is what a caller branches on, is exact. **Tested by:**
corpus `2649-top-level-await-pending` and
`2651-top-level-await-pending-unhandled` (the exit code, with the stderr
compare skipped for nonzero exits) plus the wasm top-level-await unit test
(exit 13 with the armed timer's output intact).

## S014 — Crossing the `unknown` boundary COPIES; mutations do not propagate *(inherited)*

Converting a typed composite into an `unknown` value DEEP-COPIES it, and
validating one back out with `as T` copies again — so a record, array or
tuple that has crossed the boundary shares no storage with its source.
Mutating the original after the conversion is invisible to the extracted
value, and mutating the extracted value is invisible to the original.
Node's casts are erased and hand back the SAME object, so a program that
mutates across the boundary observes the change there and does not here.
This is not a wasm-tier fact: the C runtime, the LLVM lane that links it,
and the emitted wasm walkers all copy, and all three print the same
answers. **Rationale:** inherited from the C runtime's ownership design —
a `ScrDyn` OWNS its tree, so aliasing static storage would break the
refcount discipline on the native lanes (a dyn value outliving the record
it borrowed from). The wasm representation carries no such constraint —
aliasing would be perfectly representable there (the payload slot could
point at a static array's vec struct today) and simply WRONG, because it
would disagree with the native lanes; cross-lane agreement, not the
representation, is what forbids it. The copy is also what
makes the boundary's two directions symmetric: `dynCheck` must build a
typed value it can hand out, and it has nothing to alias if the source
was itself parsed. Distinct from S009, which is about a lying cast being
CHECKED rather than erased; this is about a truthful one still not
sharing. **Tested by:** the wasm emitter unit test only. No corpus
program can pin it, and not merely because the lanes agree — a program
whose output depended on the aliasing would diverge from Node and fail
the differential by construction, so the corpus can only contain
programs that never look.
